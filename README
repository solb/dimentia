Dimentia: Static dimensional analysis
Sol Boucher and Goran Žužić
=====================================

Dependencies
============
You need the following Debian packages, or your distribution's equivalents:
 - clang-3.7      (Tested with version 1:3.7-1-2 on stretch)
 - llvm-3.7       (Tested with version 1:3.7-1-2 on stretch)
 - liblapacke-dev (Tested with version 3.6.0-2 on stretch)

Building
========
First you need to build the tracevarsng and dimens LLVM analysis passes:
 $ cd annotations/
 $ make

The tracevarsng and dimens wrapper script in that same directory make it easier to run the passes: simply pass these scripts a .ll or .bc file.

Now try it out on some of our example programs:
 $ cd tests/
 $ make
 $ ../annotations/dimens annot0.ll
  <snip>
  Found 2 dimensionless variables:
  main::opnd
  main::sum

  Suggest inspecting the following source locations:
  annot0.c:6:9
  annot0.c:7:10
 $ ../annotations/dimens annot1.ll
 <snip>
 Found 2 dimensionless variables:
 main::opnd
 sum

 Suggest inspecting the following source locations:
 annot1.c:7:9
 annot1.c:8:10

Running on other programs is quite easy; just be sure to compile them with the clang options -S, --emit-llvm, and -g in order to generate .ll (LLVM intermediate) files.
We also running through opt with the -mem2reg option, which will speed up the analysis considerably.
Then run dimens on the output files as usual.
